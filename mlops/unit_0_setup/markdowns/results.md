# Expected results

If successful, the `titanic_clean.csv` file would be created in the file system back in our repo. To see it while in mage, have to go to Terminal

```bash
root@a4f2e69efad5:/home/src# ls
Dockerfile  data		mage_data  scripts    titanic_clean.csv
README.md   docker-compose.yml	mlops	   terraform
root@a4f2e69efad5:/home/src#
```

I made edits to the `filepath` var, to make the filesystem tidy and outputs to the `data` subfolder.
