## Question 5. Train a model

We will now train a linear regression model using the same code as in homework 1

* Fit a dict vectorizer
* Train a linear regression with default parameres 
* Use pick up and drop off locations separately, don't create a combination feature

Let's now use it in the pipeline. We will need to create another tranformation block, and return both the dict vectorizer and the model

What's the intercept of the model? 

Hint: print the `intercept_` field in the code block

- 21.77
- **24.77**
- 27.77
- 31.77

### Answer 5: `24.77`
